    "### Capstone Function Optimisation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are comments below, but the main description of the techniques is in the accompanying README file.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run analysis on a given Capstone function, the key function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**run_func(func_num, use_features=True, input_dir=\"Functions/Source_Data\", output_dir=\"Functions/Visualisations\")**\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "- **func_num** is the desired Capstone function number (1 to 8)\n",
    "- **use_features** controls whether to turn on feature engineering (True/False)\n",
    "- **input_dir** specifies where to find the source data, which should be in files **function_n_inputs.npy** and **function_n_outputs.npy** (where n is func_num)\n",
    "- **output_dir** specifies where to put the visualisations, which can most easily be accessed through the **index.html** file generated; a subdirectory will be created for each run\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, the approach is as follows:\n",
    "- Load input & output data for the relevant Capstone function\n",
    "- Apply a shift to the output if necessary (so that transforms such as logs can be applied later)\n",
    "- Initialise a Bayesian Optimiser class with the data\n",
    "- Optionally, include feature engineering, i.e. pre-processing to add new feature dimensions which are bespoke functions of the inputs\n",
    "- Fit a Gaussian Process (GP) with a variety of kernels, with and without log-transforming the outputs and with and without warping; use cross-validation to assess the fit and choose the best kernel\n",
    "- Fit a BoTorch model to the same data\n",
    "- Apply a variety of techniques to find the best candidate input to try next, including Expected Improvement (EI), Upper Confidene Bound (UCB) & Potential Improvement (PI) with both the GP model and the BoTorch model (the latter with and without feature engineering), but also various Monte-Carlo methods, Knowledge Gradient, Maximum Entropy Search, Thompson Sampling, Bootstrapping and Cross-Validation\n",
    "- Compare the candidates in terms of predicted mean and EI\n",
    "- Produce a range of visualisations to help choose the best candidate, including Parallel Coordinates (which helps identify patterns of promising inputs across multiple dimensions); the Prediction Surface (showing the predicted mean and uncertainty); the Acquisition Landscape of some of the standard acquisition functions; Dimensional Importance (including the feature dimensions, if used); Partial Dependence plots (showing fit vs observations for each dimension separately); Expected Improvement Landscapes (for various combinations of dimensions); Decision Boundary plots (for various combinations of dimensions and percentiles); various Dimensional Reduction Projections to analyse clustering (t-SNE, UMAP and MDS); SHAP analysis (showing the effect of each input dimension separately); a Dimension Interaction Heatmap; and some plots showing Model Fits\n",
    "- Apply human judgement to choose the best candidate, bearing in mind the expected mean and EI but also the knowledge gained from the visualisations, including the position of the various candidates in the input space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bayesian Optimiser class also contains functionality which was not used in the final analysis:\n",
    "- Deep Kernels: these were expensive to fit and performed worse than standard or warped kernels so were disabled\n",
    "- Historical Optimisation Analysis: this was designed to track the performance of the various techniques, saving and loading state each week and feeding the information into the decision for the next candidate, but this did not prove particularly helpful\n",
    "- Reverse Engineering History: this was designed to look back at the data as it was at each decision point in the past and to reverse engineer which type of acquisition function must have been used to choose the next candidate; the idea was to fill in the \"gaps\" in memory as the historical optimisation analysis was only implemented some time after the start of the project"
